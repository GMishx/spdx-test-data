Allegro 4 (the giftware license)

Allegro is gift-ware. It was created
by a number of people working in cooperation, and is given to you
freely as a gift. You may use, modify, redistribute, and generally
hack it about in any way you like, and you do not have to give us
anything in return.

However, if you like this product you are
encouraged to thank us by making a return gift to the Allegro
community. This could be by writing an add-on package, providing a
useful bug report, making an improvement to the library, or perhaps
just releasing the sources of your program so that other people can
learn from them. If you redistribute parts of this code or make a game
using it, it would be nice if you mentioned Allegro somewhere in the
credits, but you are not required to do this. We trust you not to
abuse our generosity.
