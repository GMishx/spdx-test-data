AUTOCONF CONFIGURE SCRIPT EXCEPTION

Version
3.0, 18 August 2009

Copyright Â© 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
>http://fsf.org/<

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.

This Exception is an additional permission under section 7
of the GNU General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to
a given file that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the
file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this
Exception.

The purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of
Autoconf's typical output under terms of the recipient's choice
(including proprietary).

   0. Definitions.

   "Covered Code" is the
source or object code of a version of Autoconf that is a covered work
under this License.

   "Normally Copied Code" for a version of
Autoconf means all parts of its Covered Code which that version can
copy from its code (i.e., not from its input file) into its minimally
verbose, non-debugging and non-tracing output.

   "Ineligible Code"
is Covered Code that is not Normally Copied Code.

   1. Grant of
Additional Permission.

   You have permission to propagate output of
Autoconf, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms
of GPLv3. However, if by modifying Autoconf you cause any Ineligible
Code of the version you received to become Normally Copied Code of
your modified version, then you void this Exception for the resulting
covered work. If you convey that resulting covered work, you must
remove this Exception in accordance with the second paragraph of
Section 7 of GPLv3.

   2. No Weakening of Autoconf Copyleft.

   The
availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption
that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements
of the license of Autoconf.
