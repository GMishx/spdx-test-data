2.1.8.9pre14a Copyright 2001 by Steve Grubb

This is an exerpt from an
email I recieved from the original author, allowing xinetd as
maintained by me (Rob Braun), to use the higher version numbers:

I
appreciate your maintaining the version string guidelines as specified
in the copyright. But I did not mean them to last as long as they
did.

So, if you want, you may use any 2.N.* (N >= 3) version string
for future xinetd versions that you release. Note that I am excluding
the 2.2.* line; using that would only create confusion. Naming the
next release 2.3.0 would put to rest the confusion about 2.2.1 and
2.1.8.*.
