MirOS License Copyright [YEAR]

[NAME] [EMAIL]

Provided that these
terms and disclaimer and all copyright notices are retained or
reproduced in an accompanying document, permission is granted to deal
in this work without restriction, including unlimited rights to use,
publicly perform, distribute, sell, modify, merge, give away, or
sublicence.

This work is provided "AS IS" and WITHOUT WARRANTY of any
kind, to the utmost extent permitted by applicable law, neither
express nor implied; without malicious intent or gross negligence. In
no event may a licensor, author or contributor be held liable for
indirect, direct, other damage, loss, or other issues arising in any
way out of dealing in the work, even if advised of the possibility of
such damage or existence of a defect, except proven that it results
out of said person's immediate fault when using the work as intended.
I_N_S_T_R_U_C_T_I_O_N_S_:_

To apply the template(1) specify the years
of copyright (separated by comma, not as a range), the legal names of
the copyright holders, and the real names of the authors if different.
Avoid adding text.

R_A_T_I_O_N_A_L_E_:_

This licence is apt for any
kind of work (such as source code, fonts, documentation, graphics,
sound etc.) and the preferred terms for work added to MirBSD. It has
been drafted as universally usable equivalent of the "historic
permission notice"(2) adapted to Europen law because in some (droit
d'auteur) countries authors cannot disclaim all liabi‚Äê lities.
Compliance to DFSG(3) 1.1 is ensured, and GPLv2 compatibility is
asserted unless advertising clauses are used. The MirOS Licence is
certified to conform to OKD(4) 1.0 and OSD(5) 1.9, and qualifies as a
Free Software(6) and also Free Documentation(7) licence and is
included in some relevant lists(8)(9)(10).

We believe you are not
liable for work inserted which is intellectual property of third
parties, if you were not aware of the fact, act appropriately as soon
as you become aware of that problem, seek an amicable solution for all
parties, and never knowingly distribute a work without being
authorised to do so by its licensors.
