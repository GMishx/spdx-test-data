SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE

Version 1.0 - 22 November 2005

PREAMBLE

The
goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of cooperative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide an open
framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied,
modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by
themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled,
embedded, redistributed and sold with any software provided that the
font names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of
license.

DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to any and all of the
following:

   - font files

   - data files

   - source code

   -
build scripts

   - documentation

"Reserved Font Name" refers to the
Font Software name as seen by users and any other names as specified
after the copyright statement.

"Standard Version" refers to the
collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright
Holder.

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative font software
made by adding to, deleting, or substituting â€” in part or in whole
-- any of the components of the Standard Version, by changing formats
or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.

"Author" refers
to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other
person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION &
CONDITIONS

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any
person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy,
merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified
copies of the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:

  
1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in
Standard or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

   2) Standard
or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the
user.

   3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the
Reserved Font Name(s), in part or in whole, unless explicit written
permission is granted by the Copyright Holder. This restriction
applies to all references stored in the Font Software, such as the
font menu name and other font description fields, which are used to
differentiate the font from others.

   4) The name(s) of the
Copyright Holder or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be
used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to
acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder and the
Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.

   5) The Font
Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be
distributed using this license, and may not be distributed under any
other license.

TERMINATION

This license becomes null and void if any
of the above conditions are not met.

DISCLAIMER

THE FONT SOFTWARE IS
PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT,
PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING
ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT
OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER
DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.
