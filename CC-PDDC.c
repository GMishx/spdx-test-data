public domain of the country from which the work is published, or (b)
hereby dedicates whatever copyright the dedicators holds in the work
of authorship identified below (the "Work") to the public domain. A
certifier, moreover, dedicates any copyright interest he may have in

A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify
the copyright status of this work. Certifier recognizes that his good

certified is not in the public domain.

Dedicator makes this
dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to the detriment
of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends this
dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all
present and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or
contingent, in the Work. Dedicator understands that such
relinquishment of all rights includes the relinquishment of all rights
to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those copyrights in the
Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain,
the Work may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used,
modified, built upon, or otherwise exploited by anyone for any
purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and in any way, including by
methods that have not yet been invented or conceived.
