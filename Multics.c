Multics License Historical Background

This edition of the Multics
software materials and documentation is provided and donated to
Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN
Information Systems Inc. as a contribution to computer science
knowledge. This donation is made also to give evidence of the common
contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell
Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc.,
Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL and BULL HN Information Systems Inc.
to the development of this operating system. Multics development was
initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC
(1963-1970), renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and
Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership of
Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided
the best software architecture for managing computer hardware properly
and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems
incorporated Multics principles. Multics was distributed in 1975 to
2000 by Group Bull in Europe, and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information
Systems Inc., as successor in interest by change in name only to
Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
