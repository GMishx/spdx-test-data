Simple Public License (SimPL) Preamble

This Simple Public License 2.0
(SimPL 2.0 for short) is a plain language implementation of GPL 2.0.
The words are different, but the goal is the same - to guarantee for
all users the freedom to share and change software. If anyone wonders
about the meaning of the SimPL, they should interpret it as consistent
with GPL 2.0. Simple Public License (SimPL) 2.0

The SimPL applies to
the software's source and object code and comes with any rights that I
have in it (other than trademarks). You agree to the SimPL by copying,
distributing, or making a derivative work of the software.

You get
the royalty free right to:

   - Use the software for any purpose;

  
- Make derivative works of it (this is called a "Derived Work");

   -
Copy and distribute it and any Derived Work.

If you distribute the
software or a Derived Work, you must give back to the community by:

 
 - Prominently noting the date of any changes you make;

   - Leaving
other people's copyright notices, warranty disclaimers, and license
terms in place;

   - Providing the source code, build scripts,
installation scripts, and interface definitions in a form that is easy
to get and best to modify;

   - Licensing it to everyone under SimPL,
or substantially similar terms (such as GPL 2.0), without adding
further restrictions to the rights provided;

   - Conspicuously
announcing that it is available under that license.

There are some
things that you must shoulder:

   - You get NO WARRANTIES. None of
any kind;

   - If the software damages you in any way, you may only
recover direct damages up to the amount you paid for it (that is zero
if you did not pay anything). You may not recover any other damages,
including those called "consequential damages." (The state or country
where you live may not allow you to limit your liability in this way,
so this may not apply to you);

The SimPL continues perpetually,
except that your license rights end automatically if:

   - You do not
abide by the "give back to the community" terms (your licensees get to
keep their rights if they abide);

   - Anyone prevents you from
distributing the software under the terms of the SimPL.

License for
the License

You may do anything that you want with the SimPL text;
it's a license form to use in any way that you find helpful. To avoid
confusion, however, if you change the terms in any way then you may
not call your license the Simple Public License or the SimPL (but feel
free to acknowledge that your license is "based on the Simple Public
License").
