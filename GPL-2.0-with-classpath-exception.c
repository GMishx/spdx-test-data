Class Path Exception

Linking this
library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of
the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

As a
special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
module. An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
based on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this
exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
from your version.
