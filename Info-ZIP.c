interfaces, versions with modified or added functionality, and
dynamic, shared, or static library versions not from Info-ZIP--must be

Such altered versions also must not be misrepresented as being
Info-ZIP releases--including, but not limited to, labeling of the
altered versions with the names "Info-ZIP" (or any variation thereof,
including, but not limited to, different capitalizations), "Pocket
UnZip," "WiZ" or "MacZip" without the explicit permission of Info-ZIP.
Such altered versions are further prohibited from misrepresentative
